#Mongo

This app allows users to skim over articles, connect to them, save notes based on them and revisit articles that they've saved notes. It also can delete the articles from the database if they are not needed. 

The app works with Mongodb, Mongoose, and Cheerio to put the articles in a database and scrape from a (fake) news site.
